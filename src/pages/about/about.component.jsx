import React from 'react';

const About = () => (
    <div className='about'>
        <h1 className='text-4xl'>About</h1>
        <p className='text-2xl'>
            This could probably be a simple centered card with some information as to why I wanted to make this.
        </p>
    </div>
)

export default About;
